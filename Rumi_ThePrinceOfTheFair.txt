 A garden--may its rose be in flower to Resurrection!
 An idol--may the two worlds be scattered o'er his beauty!
 The Prince of the Fair goes proudly forth to the chase
 at morning;
 May our hearts fall a prey to the arrow of His glance
 From His eye what messages are passing continually to mine!
 May my eyes be gladdened and filled with intoxication by
 His Message!
