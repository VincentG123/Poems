We are as the flute, and the music in us is from thee; 
we are as the mountain and the echo in us is from thee.

We are as pieces of chess engaged in victory and defeat: 
our victory and defeat is from thee, O thou whose qualities are comely!

Who are we, O Thou soul of our souls, 
that we should remain in being beside thee?

We and our existences are really non-existence; 
thou art the absolute Being which manifests the perishable.

We all are lions, but lions on a banner: 
because of the wind they are rushing onward from moment to moment.

Their onward rush is visible, and the wind is unseen: 
may that which is unseen not fail from us!

Our wind whereby we are moved and our being are of thy gift; 
our whole existence is from thy bringing into being.
