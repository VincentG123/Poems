A man
standing on two logs in a river
might do all right floating with the current
while humming in the
now.
Though
if one log is tied to a camel,
who is also heading south along the bank - at the same pace-
all could still be well
with the 
world
unless the camel
thinks he forgot something, and
abruptly turns upstream,
then
uh-oh.
Most minds
do not live in the present
and can stick to a reasonable plan; most minds abruptly turn
and undermine the
chance
of
humming.
