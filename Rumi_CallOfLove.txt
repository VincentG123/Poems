At every instant and from every side, resounds the call of Love: 
We are going to sky, who wants to come with us? 
We have gone to heaven, we have been the friends of the angels, 
And now we will go back there, for there is our country. 
We are higher than heaven, more noble than the angels: 
Why not go beyond them? Our goal is the Supreme Majesty. 
What has the fine pearl to do with the world of dust? 
Why have you come down here? Take your baggage back. What is this place? 
Luck is with us, to us is the sacrifice!... 
Like the birds of the sea, men come from the ocean--the ocean of the soul. 
Like the birds of the sea, men come from the ocean--the ocean of the soul. 
How could this bird, born from that sea, make his dwelling here? 
No, we are the pearls from the bosom of the sea, it is there that we dwell: 
Otherwise how could the wave succeed to the wave that comes from the soul? 
The wave named 'Am I not your Lord' has come, it has broken the vessel of the body; 
And when the vessel is broken, the vision comes back, and the union with Him.
