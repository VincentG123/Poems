Since yesterday had throw me and bolt,
Today has hurt my heart even more.

The autumn wildgeese have a long wing for escort
As I face them from this villa, drinking my wine.

The bones of great writers are your brushes, in the school of heaven,
And I am Lesser Hsieh growing up by your side.

We both are exalted to distant thought,
Aspiring to the sky and the bright moon.

But since water still flows, though we cut it with our swords,
And sorrow return,though we drown them with wine,
Since the world can in no way answer our craving,
I will loosen my hair tomorrow and take to a fishing-boat.
